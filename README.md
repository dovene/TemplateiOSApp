# TemplateiOsApp

This repository contains an iOS Template project using a movie database API from TMDb and aims at showing how to use
the three main types of view within an app which are a formu, a list and a detail element.

Furthermore you may find two branches that showcases the use of MVC and MVVM alongside with reactive programming architectures.

Carthage, Moya, RxSwift, SwiftBeaver and PinRemoteImage are third party libraries that were used within this project.
