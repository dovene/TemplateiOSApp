# TemplateiOsApp

This repository contains an iOS Template project using a movie database API from TMDb and aims at showing how to use
the three main types of view you may have to use while building an app namely a form, a list and a detail item.

Furthermore you may find two branches that showcases the use of MVC and MVVM alongside with reactive programming pattern.

Carthage, Moya, RxSwift, SwiftBeaver and PinRemoteImage are third party libraries that were mixed together to build this project.

And for those who enjoys both the taste of an apple and a lollipop you may find the same project developed in Android right here  https://github.com/dovene/TemplateAndroidApp.
